Bridging the Health Information Gap in Rural Africa

## 📖 About The Project

Africare is an AI-powered community health chatbot designed to tackle the critical shortage of healthcare professionals in rural Africa. By providing medically verified information in local languages and operating offline, Africare bridges the gap between patients and doctors.

## 🚩 The Problem

- Severe Shortage: 1 doctor for every 5,000+ people in many rural communities.

- Misinformation: Dangerous home remedies spread via word-of-mouth when professional advice is inaccessible.

- Language Barriers: Most health information is in English/French, excluding local dialect speakers.

## 💡 The Solution

Africare is an intelligent chatbot that:

- Works Offline: accessible in low-connectivity areas.

- Speaks Local Languages: supports Twi, Swahili, Fante, Ga, and Ewe.

- Is Medically Verified: cross-references queries against safe medical protocols.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Multilingual Support: Breaking language barriers for inclusive care.

- Offline-First Architecture: innovative edge-computing for remote access.

- Instant Triage: Immediate responses to common health queries.

- Voice Integration: (Roadmap) Voice-to-text for users with low literacy.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Ask: User inputs a query via text or voice.

- Verify: AI checks the query against a verified medical database.

- Answer: User receives an instant, actionable response.
